                        Airlines and hotel corrections are the most challenging part of this service. We have been
                        providing these corrections free of cost to our customers since 2017 when we started this
                        website. But with the passage of time, airlines changed policies numerous times, and the same
                        applies to hotels—but we never asked for additional money from our customers. Because we believe
                        in providing service to customers at affordable prices with consistency. However, in June 2024,
                        we decided to shift this minor cost to our customers—but not entirely.

                        Starting 1st July 2024, all order corrections will not be free—whether it's flight or hotel.
                        However, insurance changes are still free if the number of days and ages are the same (only
                        allowed up to 10 days before the insurance effective date).
