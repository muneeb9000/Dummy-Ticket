         Airlines and hotel corrections are the most challenging part of this service, we have been providing these corrections free of cost to our customers since 2017 when we started this website. But with the passage of time airlines changed the policies numerous times and the same for hotels but we never ask for additional money from our customers. Because we believe in providing service to customers at
          affordable prices with consistency. But in June 2024 we decided to shift this minor cost to our customer but not entirely.
        </p>
        <p class="text-base md:text-[16px] break-words text-justify">
         With the start of 1st July 2024, all order corrections will not be free whether it is flight or hotel. Whereas
          for insurance changes are still free if the number of days and ages are the same (Only allows 10 before the insurance effective date).

          If you are our customer and place the flight reservation order and if our team made any kind of mistake then we are responsible for making it exactly according to your needs and details which you elaborate on in your flight details.
           In case our team makes any kind of mistake then we will do the corrections as many times as Free Of Cost.
        </p>
        <p class="list-disc w-full space-y-2 break-words text-justify">
          
            In another case, if you are unable to provide any details in your order or if you would like to add something like flight legs, changing the dates, a mistake in names or titles, or changing the date of arrivals or any kind of new change, which you didn’t tell us in your order flight details or within additional details field in the form then you will bear the cost of $5 for each correction on one reservation document. You will pay this 
            cost through our custom payment link where you will Select “You’re Making Payment For?” As “Flight Corrections” or “Hotel Corrections”.
        </p>
        <p class="list-disc w-full space-y-2 break-words text-justify">
        Corrections don’t mean changing the traveller’s name entirely, whereas you can not even change the first name entirely but yes spelling change is acceptable in corrections.
        </p>
        <p class="list-disc w-full space-y-2 break-words text-justify">
            If you want to change the traveller name entirely then we would advise you to place a new order same as you did before.  
              </p>
        <p class="list-disc w-full space-y-2 break-words text-justify">
           Once you get the correction and if you come back to us later within 2 weeks (counted from the day one when you placed the order) then you will again pay for correction if needed. This process can be only
            available for the 2-week time period (counted from day one when you placed the order the first time not from the correction date/time).

            If you ask for changes or modifications in your provided routes and dates (Flight /Hotel Details) after we sent you your documents to your email. It is because airlines don’t allow us to make changes in existing or generated reservations they only allow us to create a new one, that is why we recommend in case of modification place another order and repeat the same process again. We know this is awkward or weird but that is the only thing we can do for you.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you come back to us due to the cancelled reservation so please first note the FAQs validation time guidelines if we are not against this then a refund would not be possible.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you come in the future and ask for a refund just because you didn’t use our documents so in that case, we won’t refund you.

            If you want to make amendments to your reservation after the 5 days of delivery of your documents.

           If your visa is refused because of our provided documents/services and you’re not able to show sufficient proof that your visa denied reason is our docs then a refund is not possible, you have to show the embassy a written letter for the visa refusal cause to us to initiate the refund.
          </li>
          <li>
            In case you receive the documents early and you saw that after the time so we don’t refund.
